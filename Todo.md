### Todo

- [ ] i18n Routing (from Astro 3.5)
- [ ] Find a way to avoid rebuilding existing images every build?
- [ ] Related Post -> Avoid 3 more query per posts by adding the feature image field direclty to the Post object ACF Post object using acf_standard formating (ACF's post object seems different than WP Post Object, so maybe we'll have to add it to both). Even with standard, ACF doesn't surgace the \_embed field.
- [ ] Destroy local cache on astro:build:done ?
